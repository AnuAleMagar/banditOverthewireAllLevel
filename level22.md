#level22

##Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.



##Solution
```
ls
cd /etc/cron.d
ls
cat cronjob_bandit23
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh 
bash -x /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh 
echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum |cut -d ' ' -f 1 //here we get the target value
cat /etc/targetValueGeneratedJustAbove
```
here by closely observing the /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh ,i came to know that mytarget value is generated by that "echo I am user $myname | md5sum |cut -d ' ' -f 1".At first i tried to change the script and change the whoami value to bandit23 but it was not permitted. So above method was the correct way to do it.
